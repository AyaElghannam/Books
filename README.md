## Book 1: Introduction to Machine Learning with Python

Introduction to Machine Learning with Python is a gentle introduction into machine learning. It doesn’t assume any knowledge about Python and it introduces fundamental concepts and applications of machine learning, discussing various methods through examples. That’s the best book I’ve ever seen for an entry level Machine Learning Engineer.
